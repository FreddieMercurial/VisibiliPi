# VisibiliPi
Visualizing Pi using RGB

- Calculates the Nth digit of Pi, starting at zero (incrementing with each button click)
- Converts the digit (0-15) to a fraction (1/16ths of the visible spectrum) and displays the wavelength
- Converts the wavelength to RGB values (gamma corrected) and displays the RGB values and color on the main window.

Very clunky quickly thrown together app.

# More info
- the n'th digit of Pi (in hex), which is technically a nibble, is now a 0-15 value
 0. 243f6a8885
 1. 43F6A8885A

... and so on
